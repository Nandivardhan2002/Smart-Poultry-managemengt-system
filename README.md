# Smart-Poultry-managemengt-system
Many poultry farmers are performing diverse operations in their farms manually. Therefore, they experience a huge 
financial loss due to inability to properly automate the monitoring and to detect fire accidents and control of environmental factors 
such as temperature, humidity, light and air quality and to ensure an adequate supply of feed and water. These factors adversely 
affect the chicks and leaving them uncontrolled might cause health problems for the chicks. This affects the chicks’ feed intake and 
leads to an increase in mortality rate and increases chances of diseases. Therefore, this system seeks to address automating those 
factors by developing an smart poultry farm. The system consists of a microcontroller, actuators, and sensors as major components. 
We display data collected from the sensors to the operators of the farm. The system is able to detect fire accidents before or after it 
happens and informs to the users immediately and system is able to sense environmental parameter status and responds accordingly 
to regulate and maintain an optimum condition for improved health conditions for the chicks. The smart system reduces the fire 
accidents and improves productivity and environmental or climatic conditions in the poultry farm, making it conducive for the 
broiler chicks
